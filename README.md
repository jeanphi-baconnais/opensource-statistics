# Opensource-statistiques 📊

🚧 This project is in progress ... 

One objective of this project is to highlight Zenika members contributions. 

To do this, the zenika-open-source GitHub Organization is scanned and data could be saved in a Database.
Datas could be used to find / list all projects maintained by Zenika Members, all projects which Zenika members contributed, etc.

## 🗄️ Tech 

Using Quarkus, [Cloud SQL](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-google-cloud#using-cloud-sql) to save data and GitHub actions as CICD.

## 📝 Setup 

- You need a GitHub token you can generate on [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- Create a `.env` file based on the `.env-example` file and set the token previously created.
